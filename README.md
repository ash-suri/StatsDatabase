# StatsDatabase
A desktop Java application that displays demographic data for a variety of countries through graphs and charts, created as a group project for a software engineering course.

To Install:

1. Clone repo
2. Use Eclipse to import the project as an existing Maven Project
3. Run program

Refactoring of the project may be required to avoid certain superficial compilation errors. Simply add and remove the JDK library from the project and re-add it. This should solve most of the importing errors.
